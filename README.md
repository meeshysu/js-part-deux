# JS Objects and Strings

This project was to teach us how to write strings, after of course, learning what strings were. I learned how to incorporate strings into objects and how objects and arrays worked. Arrays have [] brackets while objects have {} curly brackets. One is multiple, one is singular. You can read my array of objects if you would like. ;) We made up some fun information to test if statements, returning quote strings, functions and more. 

I accidentally smushed two different topics into one. Js-Arrays was supposed to be separate but I spaced and put it into this repo instead, so... There's just a lot going on and my screenshot gives none of that away. It just says hi hi.
